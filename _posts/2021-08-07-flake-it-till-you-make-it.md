It took a little bit. 18 months after I started my job at the University of Bath, I am so pleased to show my new website to the world.

Some people working with me in the lab just left the group, please look at the work the did in <a href="https://antoniojexposito.github.io/group" target="_blank" >Former members</a>. The exciting news is that a lot more are joining soon. Including my first PhD student.

An exciting prospect! And you will be able to follow everything here...
