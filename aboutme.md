I am a Lecturer at the 
      <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-chemical-engineering/" target="_blank">Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath</a>.
 My research interests focus on two main areas: catalyst design and reactor engineering. In particular, the development of microreactors and new hybrid photo-electrocatalysts that can be applied in environmental processes such as artificial photosynthesis.

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at
      the <a href="https://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" >University of Cambridge</a> in
      the <a href="https://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/process-integration-group" target="_blank" >Catalysis and Process Integration Group</a>. 
	  Before that I was a postdoctoral researcher at
      the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/" target="_blank">University of Warwick</a>, and a Research Scientist
      at <a href="http://www.stolicatalysts.com/" target="_blank" >Stoli Catalysts</a>.
      I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://www.uclm.es/?sc_lang=en" target="_blank">Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha</a> where I also studied as an undergraduate.
	I have also recieved a Master's degree in Renewable Energy from 
	  <a href="http://www.uam.es/" target="_blank">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a>.
