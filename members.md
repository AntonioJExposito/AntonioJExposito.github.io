## Former Members

### Research Associates

**Dr Kasia Maltby**

<p> (Nov 2020 - April 2021); Project:PhoPhyClear </p>
<p> Kasia graduated from Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland with a Masters degree in Chemical Engineering. In 2014 she moved to Bath for a PhD on renewable feedstocks at the Centre for Sustainable and Circular Technologies. The main topics of her work were terpenes epoxidation and terpene-derived cyclic carbonates. To succeed in her PhD project she had to connect with her inner chemist and specialise in running column chromatography and analysing forests of NMR peaks. After her PhD, she worked on a short project with Dr Sophie Parsons on sustainability reporting within companies. Although Kasia enjoyed learning about sustainability reporting and investigating a different side of sustainability, she missed being in the lab. In 2020 she joined the Expósito group as a Research Associate in the Phophyclear project. In her spare time, she enjoys reading books, exercising, and watching Women’s Super League on TV. Kasia is currently working as a Research Associate at the University of Leeds </p>
  
### Research Assistants

**Lucas Joel**

Lucas worked in the photodegradation of microplastics.

**Trang (Tracy) Vo**

Trang recently graduated from University of Bath with a Bachelor in Chemical Engineering. In 2019, she spent her placement year working multiple roles within the Integrated Supply Chain department of AkzoNobel, where she learned about different aspects of paint manufacture and distribution. During her final year, Trang participated in the Vertically Integrated Project, and her group had successfully produced the “E-scooter impact report” which provides policymakers with an academic insight into how e-scooters within the city of Bath will impact the environment and road safety. In 2021, she worked with Dr Antonio Expósito on simulating the electroreduction of carbon dioxide using Aspen HYSYS. This has motivated her in pursuing a career in research and she is looking forward to future opportunities. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, painting, and watching crime documentaries.
